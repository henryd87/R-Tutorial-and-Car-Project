This car project was a tutorial of understand R in-depth and provided by Equitable Equations on YouTube. We utilized car data from Kaggle to see certain types of situation; Equitable Equations utilized the data to find histograms and creating a column that transferred original mileage into metric. I utilized the data to see which years made the most models of cars that had an average highway mileage above the median of the highway mileage column (24). Overall, this experience provided to my R curriculum.
